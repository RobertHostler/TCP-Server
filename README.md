# TCP-Server
A very simple login system built with a command line TCP server and client. I built
this from scratch in Python. Right now it can only be used by running two terminals
on the same machine; one runs the client script and the other runs the server script.
I do not know what to do with this yet, but I have some ideas to expand this project.
